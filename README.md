This is an implementation of heuristic search algorithm to solve the 8Puzzle problem.
heuristic_random.py file contains functions to execute heuristic search. 
test_puzzle.py file cretas a random puzzle and solves it by using heuristic algorithm.
It calculates the performance and prints the state of the puzzzle at each step
